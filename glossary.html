<p><strong><u>Alpha-Value</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>CART:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Cross-Validation/CV:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Data-Leak:</u></strong> When a fit or transform is run on test data. &nbsp;This will allow the model to learn test data which is not correct. &nbsp;Fit and/or transform should only be run on train and validation data.</p>
<p><strong><u>Decision Tree:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Entropy:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Fit:</u></strong> Building a model</p>
<p><strong><u>GridSearchCV: </u></strong>a form of model building when an entire search-space of hyper-parameters is defined and each parameter combination is exhaustively tried. &nbsp;This takes more time and computing power as compared to RandomizedSearchCV. &nbsp;A specific set of paramter values are supplied in this case.</p>
<p><strong><u>Hyper-Parameter:</u></strong> Tunable settings that can be adjusted/fine-tuned to make an algorithm/model fit data better.</p>
<p><strong><u>Lasso Regression:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>OneHotEncoding</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>OverFitting:</u> </strong>When the score being measured performs perfectly or almost perfectly on training data with a big discrepancy as compared to test data. &nbsp;There may be high errors in test data as well.</p>
<p><strong><u>SMOTE</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>SUM of Square Errors:</u></strong> This should be minimized in a linear regression model. &nbsp;This equates to the difference between the predicted Y values and the actual Y values using each X variable coefficient and then the whole value is squared. &nbsp;The lower the value, the better. &nbsp;This is a loss-function.</p>
<p><strong><u>Test-Data:</u></strong> This would be the unseen data or production data. &nbsp;Never run fit or transform on this set.</p>
<p><strong><u>Train-Data:</u></strong> This would be the data that is used to train a model. &nbsp;It is ok to run fit and/or transform here.</p>
<p><strong><u>Transform:</u></strong> Changing data. &nbsp;Typically used when standardization, or normalization of data is used. &nbsp;This is often run in tandem with fit.</p>
<p><strong><u>RandomizedSearchCV: </u></strong>a form of model building when an entire search-space of hyper-parameters is defined but only a random subset of these combinations are tried in an attempt to find the best model. &nbsp;This is quicker and can get very close to optimization that is found with GridSearch. &nbsp;A range of parameter values are defined in this case.</p>
<p><strong><u>Recall</u></strong>: gives the ratio of true positives to actual positives. &nbsp;This means low false negatives (IE: lower changes of predicting someone bad as good).</p>
<p><strong><u>UnderFitting:</u></strong> When the score being measured is low on train and test data. &nbsp;The model is not able to predict well.</p>
<p><strong><u>Z-Score:</u></strong></p>
