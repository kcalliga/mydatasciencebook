<p>Welcome to the MyDataScienceBook website. &nbsp;This is an attempt by me to share the notes I have taken based on my learnings through my recent schooling and also many texts I have referenced. &nbsp;Secondly, I am trying to find the best way to organize this information so that is easy to find when I am studying or attempting some hackathon. I hope to make this one of my only stops when I am trying to accomplish any of these tasks.</p>
<p>As I learn new things, more notes will be added to this site. &nbsp;I am very much a novice in this field but this is my attempt to learn more and have information within easy reach. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The left-hand side of the navigation will be a table of contents which is still a work in progress. &nbsp;I will write content and chapters in the coming months.</p>
<p>Much more content to come soon.</p>
